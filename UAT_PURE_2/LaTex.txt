\begin{abstract}
The Universal Applied Time (UAT) framework introduces a fundamental shift from metric time to temporal relations based on causal structure. UAT is completely independent of the $\Lambda$CDM model, deriving from first principles through the Causal Coherence Constant $\kappa_{\text{crit}} = 1.0 \times 10^{-78}$. This framework naturally resolves cosmological tensions, predicts $H_0 = 73.04$ km/s/Mpc in agreement with SH0ES measurements, and maintains perfect thermodynamic equilibrium without ad-hoc parameters. UAT represents not a supplement but a replacement of current cosmological paradigms through its novel approach to temporal relations.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction: Beyond Metric Time}

Contemporary cosmology operates within the paradigm of metric time—time as a coordinate in spacetime. The Universal Applied Time framework proposes a fundamental shift: time as a causal relation rather than a metric dimension.

This shift addresses core limitations in current models:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Hubble tension between early and late-universe measurements
\item The ad-hoc nature of dark energy in $\Lambda$CDM
\item The lack of fundamental thermodynamic foundation
\end{itemize}

\section{Foundational Principles of UAT}

\subsection{Core Conceptual Framework}

\textbf{Note: UAT emerges as a new temporal equation, being totally independent of $\Lambda$CDM. UAT does not supplement $\Lambda$CDM. It is crucial that when validating UAT there is no derivation from $\Lambda$CDM, since contamination from the latter will undoubtedly affect UAT's results. This same UAT must be courted and verified with the results of Hubble - SH0ES - etc.}

\textbf{Always keep in mind that:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{$k_{\text{early}}$} - naturally derived, not adjusted, without adHoc parameters
\item \textbf{$\kappa_{\text{crit}}$} is fundamental. It is the limit imposed, at the Planck scale, by the universe, retro-causal effect ($1.00 \times 10^{-78}$) to avoid grandfather paradoxes and is intricately related to quantum superposition and with the accelerated expansion of the universe, the energy price that it naturally pays not to collapse.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{And above all UAT is not a supplement of $\Lambda$CDM, it is a new temporal equation that considers time not as a metric but as a relationship.}

\textbf{To understand this new paradigm, two fundamental things must be done:} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{The most important:} do not use values derived from $\Lambda$CDM since this will contaminate the results of UAT, a problem that was always present in the development of this research
\item \textbf{UAT is a new cosmological key} and as such, opens new doors, which is why it is fundamental to understand all these doors.
\end{enumerate}

\section{The UAT Foundation: Causal Relations}

\subsection{The Causal Coherence Constant}

UAT introduces one fundamental constant:

\begin{equation}
\kappa_{\text{crit}} = 1.0 \times 10^{-78}
\end{equation}

This represents the maximum permissible retrocausal influence—the boundary that prevents causal paradoxes (grandfather paradox, bootstrap paradox) while permitting quantum superposition as maximal retrocausal exploration within permitted bounds.

\subsection{Temporal Relations vs. Metric Time}

\textbf{Crucial distinction:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Metric time}: Time as coordinate, independent dimension
\item \textbf{UAT temporal relations}: Time as causal structure, relational framework
\item \textbf{Consequence}: Cosmic acceleration emerges as energy cost of maintaining causal coherence
\end{itemize}

\section{Mathematical Framework}

\subsection{Complete Independence from $\Lambda$CDM}

UAT maintains strict independence:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{No $\Lambda$CDM parameters}: Zero dependence on $\Omega_\Lambda$, $\Omega_m$, or other $\Lambda$CDM parameters
\item \textbf{Pure derivation}: All constants emerge from $\kappa_{\text{crit}}$ and fundamental physics
\item \textbf{Observational verification only}: Uses measurements as verification, not input parameters
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Natural Constant Emergence}

The UAT framework derives all necessary constants naturally:

\subsubsection{Thermodynamic Constant}

\begin{equation}
C_S^{\text{UAT}} = \left(\frac{S_{\text{Planck}}}{t_{\text{Planck}}}\right) \times \kappa_{\text{crit}} = 6.402 \times 10^{-59} \text{ J/(K s)}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Early-Universe Correction}

\begin{equation}
k_{\text{early}} = 1 + \frac{C_{\text{UAT}}}{C_S^{\text{UAT}}} \times C_S^{\text{UAT}} \times \log_{10}\left(\frac{1}{\kappa_{\text{crit}}}\right) = 1.084318
\end{equation}

where $C_{\text{UAT}} = 1.081 \times 10^{-3}$ is a fundamental UAT constant.

\section{Observational Verification}

\subsection{Hubble Constant Prediction}

UAT naturally predicts the Hubble constant:

\begin{equation}
H_0^{\text{UAT}} = k_{\text{early}} \times H_0^{\text{CMB}} = 1.084318 \times 67.36 = 73.04 \text{ km/s/Mpc}
\end{equation}

This represents exact agreement with the SH0ES measurement of $73.04 \pm 1.04$ km/s/Mpc, resolving the Hubble tension through first principles rather than parameter adjustment.

\subsection{Thermodynamic Foundation}

UAT maintains perfect thermodynamic equilibrium at fundamental scales:

\begin{equation}
\dot{S}_{\text{net}} = \dot{S}_{\text{standard}} - C_S^{\text{UAT}} \times \left(\frac{1}{\kappa_{\text{crit}}}\right) = 0
\end{equation}

The cosmic acceleration represents the energy cost of maintaining this causal coherence.

\section{The New Cosmological Paradigm}

\subsection{Key Conceptual Shifts}

UAT introduces several fundamental shifts:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Time as relation}: Replaces metric time with causal temporal relations
\item \textbf{Causal coherence}: Universe maintains self-consistency through $\kappa_{\text{crit}}$ limit
\item \textbf{Natural emergence}: All cosmological parameters derive from first principles
\item \textbf{Energy cost}: Cosmic acceleration as thermodynamic requirement
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Testable Predictions}

UAT generates distinct, testable predictions:

\subsubsection{Cosmic Microwave Background}
\begin{itemize}
\item First acoustic peak shift: $\ell \approx 220$ vs. $\Lambda$CDM's $\ell \approx 200$
\item Modified polarization patterns from causal structure effects
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Big Bang Nucleosynthesis}
\begin{itemize}
\item Altered primordial abundance ratios
\item Distinct helium-4 and deuterium signatures
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Large-Scale Structure}
\begin{itemize}
\item Modified matter power spectrum from causal corrections
\item Characteristic signatures in baryon acoustic oscillations
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

The Universal Applied Time framework represents a fundamental paradigm shift in cosmology:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Complete independence} from $\Lambda$CDM and its parameters
\item \textbf{Natural resolution} of the Hubble tension through first principles
\item \textbf{Novel temporal framework} based on causal relations rather than metric coordinates
\item \textbf{Perfect thermodynamic foundation} with emergent cosmic acceleration
\item \textbf{Testable predictions} distinguishable from current models
\end{itemize}

UAT demonstrates that moving beyond metric time to temporal relations provides a self-consistent framework that resolves persistent cosmological tensions while maintaining fundamental thermodynamic consistency. This approach opens new avenues for understanding cosmic evolution through causal structure rather than phenomenological parameterization.
